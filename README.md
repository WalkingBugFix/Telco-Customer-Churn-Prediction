**Objective**
The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn in a telecommunications company using historical customer data. The insights gained will be used to design targeted customer retention programs aimed at reducing churn and improving customer lifetime value.

**Background**
Customer churn — when customers stop doing business with a company — is a critical problem for telecom companies, where customer acquisition costs are high, and switching barriers are low. Understanding which customers are likely to leave and why enables companies to intervene proactively and retain valuable customers.

IBM’s sample dataset on Telco Customer Churn provides an excellent foundation for building predictive models and designing actionable strategies.
